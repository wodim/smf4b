smf4b (smf for bots)
====================

smf very slightly tuned to make bots happy.

installation is easy: install normally, calling your account "root".
then create another account (which must have 2 as its id) called
"Someone". if you want you can change the display names for them later.

then configure your forum. let everybody post everywhere, disable
all captchas and limits, misconfigure your mail settings on purpose
(for example set server type as smtp with an address of 255.255.255.255),
etc.

in the smf_log_activity table, you may want to change all columns
to use mediumint instead of smallint, which has a limit of 65535 and
will most probably not be enough.

if you have problems of space or just want to make everything go faster,
you can have the empty.sql file executed every hour or so to empty
the forum. that removes all users, threads and posts, but the stats are
preserved. you can also optimise the tables and flush all caches from
time to time. take this crontab as an example.

*/10 * * * * mysql -usmf -psmf smf < /srv/http/smf/empty.sql
*/30 * * * * mysqlcheck -r -usmf -psmf smf && mysqlcheck -o -usmf -psmf smf
*/30 * * * * find /srv/http/smf/cache/ -type f -delete
*/30 * * * * find /srv/http/smf/attachments/ -type f -delete

in my experience, myisam tables get corrupted every few days, and ariadb
crashes all the time, so you may want to convert all your tables to innodb.
you can also use row compression with innodb, at the expense of cpu use.

you probably also want google not to crawl your site. you can create a
local.php file inside the root folder and that code will be executed before
everything. so you can have code there to check for the googlebot user
agent, return a 404 and then exit().
